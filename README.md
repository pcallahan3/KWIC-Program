What criteria did you use to decompose the first design?
What criteria did you use to decompose the second design?
Which design is more resilient to change? And why?
What would have to change in the first design/implementation if the file were changed out for a database?
What would have to change in the second design/implementation if the file were changed out for a database?
What would have to change in the first vs second design/implementation if we wanted to use a graphical user interface instead of the traditional console UI (System.out)?
Identify another change that may happen in the future, and how does design 1 compare to design 2 when it comes to impact of the change?
Which design/implementation is easier to understand?
Which design/implementation is better performing?
How does the principle of information hiding relate to all of this?
