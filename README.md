5.What would have to change in the second design/implementation if the file were changed out for a database?
6.What would have to change in the first vs second design/implementation if we wanted to use a graphical user interface instead of the traditional console UI (System.out)?
7.Identify another change that may happen in the future, and how does design 1 compare to design 2 when it comes to impact of the change?
8.Which design/implementation is easier to understand?
9.Which design/implementation is better performing?
10.How does the principle of information hiding relate to all of this?
